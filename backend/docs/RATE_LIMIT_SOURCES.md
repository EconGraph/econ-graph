# Rate Limit Sources and Verification

## Current Rate Limits in Codebase

Based on the current implementation in `backend/src/models/data_source.rs`, here are the configured rate limits:

**Legend:**
- ‚úÖ **VERIFIED** - Official documentation or direct communication from API provider
- üîç **ESTIMATED** - Educated guess based on industry standards and API patterns
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **UNKNOWN** - No information available, using conservative defaults

### U.S. Government Sources

## Methodology

### Honest Assessment: All Rate Limits Are Educated Guesses

**Important**: All rate limits in our system are **estimated** based on industry patterns and reasonable assumptions. **None have been officially verified** with the API providers.

### Estimation Approach

Our rate limits are based on:

1. **Industry Patterns**: Common API rate limiting patterns (60-1000 requests/minute)
2. **Organization Type**: Different limits for different types of organizations:
   - **Government APIs**: 120-500 requests/minute (conservative for public data)
   - **International Organizations**: 1000 requests/minute (generous for global research)
   - **Central Banks**: 1000 requests/minute (generous for research purposes)
3. **Data Volume Needs**: Higher limits for APIs that provide large datasets
4. **Conservative Estimates**: We err on the side of caution to avoid being blocked
5. **Graceful Degradation**: Our system can handle rate limit violations gracefully

### Rate Limit Categories

- **Government APIs (FRED, BLS, Census, BEA, FHFA)**: 120-500 requests/minute
- **International Organizations (World Bank, IMF, ECB, OECD, etc.)**: 1000 requests/minute
- **Central Banks (BoE, BoJ, RBA, BoC, SNB)**: 1000 requests/minute
- **UN Agencies (UNSD, ILO)**: 1000 requests/minute

## Verification Needed

### Immediate Actions Required

1. **Contact API Providers**: Reach out to each organization to obtain official rate limits
2. **Monitor Response Headers**: Check for rate limit information in API response headers
3. **Test with Increasing Load**: Gradually increase request rates to find actual limits
4. **Document Violations**: Record any 429 (Too Many Requests) responses

### Recommended Verification Process

```bash
# Test script to find actual rate limits
for source in FRED BLS CENSUS BEA; do
  echo "Testing $source rate limits..."
  # Start with our configured limit
  # Gradually increase until we get 429 responses
  # Record the actual limit
done
```

## Recommendations

### Short Term
1. **Keep Current Settings**: Our conservative limits are safe and unlikely to cause issues
2. **Monitor Logs**: Watch for any rate limit violations or 429 responses
3. **Add Rate Limit Headers**: Check response headers for rate limit information

### Long Term
1. **Establish Official Contacts**: Build relationships with API providers
2. **Implement Dynamic Rate Limiting**: Adjust limits based on actual API responses
3. **Create Rate Limit Registry**: Maintain a database of verified rate limits
4. **Regular Verification**: Periodically check for updated rate limit policies

## Summary

### What We Know vs. What We Guess

**‚úÖ What We Have Evidence For:**
- None of the APIs publish explicit rate limits in their documentation
- Our crawler implements proper politeness mechanisms (delays, user-agent identification, error handling)
- Industry standard API rate limits typically range from 60-1000 requests/minute

**üîç What Are Educated Guesses:**
- **ALL** of our current rate limits (120-1000 requests/minute)
- The reasoning behind different limits for different organization types
- The assumption that government/international APIs have generous limits

**‚ö†Ô∏è What We Don't Know:**
- Actual rate limits for any API
- Whether our guesses are too conservative or too aggressive
- How API providers actually enforce rate limiting

### Risk Assessment

**Current Risk**: **UNKNOWN** - We don't know if our rate limits are appropriate, but they're likely conservative.

**Potential Issues**:
- **Too Conservative**: We might be crawling much slower than necessary
- **Too Aggressive**: We might get blocked or rate-limited unexpectedly

### Recommendations

**Immediate Actions**:
1. **Monitor for 429 responses** (Too Many Requests) to detect actual rate limits
2. **Start with current conservative settings** and gradually increase if no issues occur
3. **Implement rate limit detection** from response headers
4. **Contact API providers** to obtain official rate limit information

**Long-term Goals**:
1. **Build a rate limit registry** based on actual testing and provider communication
2. **Implement dynamic rate limiting** that adjusts based on API responses
3. **Create verification processes** for each new data source

### Bottom Line

**We're making educated guesses based on industry patterns, but we have no solid evidence for any of our rate limits. This is honest and transparent - we're not pretending to have verified information we don't have.**
