## ðŸŽ¤ **DEMO SCRIPT & ACTIONS:**

### [0-15 seconds] **Opening & Value Proposition**
**SAY:** "This is EconGraph - a working economic data visualization prototype. What you're seeing is the actual React application running locally, not a mockup or slideshow."

**DO:** 
- Show the main dashboard loading
- Point out the professional Material-UI interface
- Highlight the navigation menu

### [15-45 seconds] **Core Business Value**
**SAY:** "For economists and analysts, this solves real problems. Instead of using multiple tools or complex spreadsheets, you get interactive charts, data transformations, and search all in one place."

**DO:**
- Click on "Data Sources" to show available economic data
- Demonstrate the search functionality by typing "GDP" or "inflation"
- Show the autocomplete suggestions working

### [45-75 seconds] **Interactive Charts Demo**
**SAY:** "Here's where it gets powerful. These aren't static charts - they're fully interactive with real data transformations."

**DO:**
- Navigate to a chart view (Dashboard or specific series)
- Show hover tooltips on data points
- Demonstrate date range selection
- Switch between YoY, QoQ, MoM transformations
- Show zoom and pan functionality

### [75-105 seconds] **Technical Capabilities**
**SAY:** "Under the hood, this is a full-stack application: React frontend, Rust backend with GraphQL API, and PostgreSQL database. It's production-ready architecture, not just a prototype."

**DO:**
- Open browser dev tools briefly to show GraphQL queries
- Navigate between different pages to show routing works
- Demonstrate responsive design by resizing browser window

### [105-135 seconds] **Search & Data Management**
**SAY:** "The full-text search makes finding economic indicators fast and intuitive. This is the kind of user experience economists deserve."

**DO:**
- Use the global search bar
- Filter results by source or frequency
- Show search results with relevance ranking
- Click through to view specific data series

### [135-165 seconds] **Business Impact & ROI**
**SAY:** "For organizations, this replaces expensive tools and reduces analysis time. A team of economists can collaborate on data analysis instead of fighting with clunky interfaces."

**DO:**
- Show multiple data series comparison
- Demonstrate export functionality if available
- Navigate smoothly between features to show integration

### [165-195 seconds] **Future Vision (Roadmap)**
**SAY:** "This is just the beginning. Our roadmap includes machine learning models, LSTM forecasting, interactive world maps, and advanced analytics - all built on this solid foundation."

**DO:**
- Show the current features working smoothly
- Emphasize the professional UI and responsive design
- Maybe open the GitHub repository to show the roadmap

### [195-210 seconds] **Closing**
**SAY:** "EconGraph: a working prototype today, with a vision for advanced economic analysis tomorrow. Built with React, Rust, and real attention to user experience."

**DO:**
- Return to the main dashboard
- Show the overall application one final time
- End with the EconGraph logo or title
