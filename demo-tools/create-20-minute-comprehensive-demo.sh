# Segment 1: Market Opportunity & Problem Statement (3 minutes)
say -v Daniel -o ../demo-videos/demo-01-market-opportunity.aiff "Welcome to EconGraph - the future of economic intelligence platforms. Today I'll show you why EconGraph represents a massive market opportunity and how we're disrupting a multi-billion dollar industry. The global economic data analytics market is worth 8.2 billion dollars and growing at 15 percent annually. Current solutions like Bloomberg Terminal cost 24,000 dollars per year per seat with limited customization and outdated user interfaces. Government agencies, financial institutions, and research organizations are crying out for modern, affordable alternatives. We're not just building another data platform - we're democratizing economic intelligence for the world. Our open-source approach provides transparency, customization, and cost savings that proprietary solutions simply cannot match."

# Segment 2: Technology Foundation Deep Dive (3 minutes)
say -v Daniel -o ../demo-videos/demo-02-technology-foundation.aiff "Let me show you the robust technology foundation that sets EconGraph apart. We've built this on cutting-edge Rust backend for maximum performance and reliability. Rust provides memory safety, zero-cost abstractions, and blazing fast performance that's essential for processing massive economic datasets. Our modern React frontend with TypeScript delivers an enterprise-grade user experience that's both powerful and intuitive. The GraphQL API provides flexible data access and seamless integration capabilities for enterprise clients. PostgreSQL with advanced indexing ensures sub-second query performance even with decades of historical data. Our Kubernetes-ready architecture means infinite scalability with 99.9 percent uptime guarantees. Every component has been chosen for enterprise reliability and performance."

# Segment 3: Core Features Demonstration (4 minutes)
say -v Daniel -o ../demo-videos/demo-03-core-features.aiff "Now let me demonstrate our powerful search and visualization capabilities that solve real user problems. Watch as I search for any economic indicator - GDP, unemployment, inflation, trade data - with instant results. Notice how our interactive charts provide hover tooltips showing exact values and complete revision history. This is crucial for economists who need to understand data quality and revisions. Our data transformations include Year-over-Year, Quarter-over-Quarter, and Month-over-Month growth calculations for comprehensive analysis. Pay special attention to how the Y-axis clearly shows the units being graphed, and notice that clicking on any series link shows the correct data - not random series like other platforms. These may seem like small details, but they're critical for professional economic analysis. Multi-country comparisons allow global economic analysis with synchronized time scales. Real-time data updates ensure you're always working with the latest information."

# Segment 4: Data Sources & Quality (3 minutes)
say -v Daniel -o ../demo-videos/demo-04-data-sources.aiff "Data quality and sourcing are fundamental to economic analysis. EconGraph integrates with authoritative sources including FRED - the Federal Reserve Economic Data system, Bureau of Labor Statistics, Bureau of Economic Analysis, and international data providers. We provide comprehensive metadata including data quality indicators, revision tracking, and source attribution. Our system tracks original releases versus revised data, which is essential for understanding the evolution of economic statistics. Historical data coverage goes back decades, providing the deep time series that economists need for proper analysis. API access enables programmatic data retrieval for quantitative researchers and automated trading systems. Custom indicator creation allows users to build derived metrics specific to their analysis needs."

# Segment 5: Business Model & Market Strategy (3 minutes)
say -v Daniel -o ../demo-videos/demo-05-business-model.aiff "Our business model is designed for rapid growth and market penetration. We use a freemium model where core features are free, building a large user base, while premium features drive revenue. Enterprise licenses cost just 2,400 dollars per year per seat - that's a 90 percent cost savings versus Bloomberg Terminal. Our target markets include financial institutions managing billions in assets, government agencies requiring economic monitoring, research organizations and universities, and consulting firms serving corporate clients. API access tiers provide additional revenue streams for developers and institutions requiring programmatic access. Custom deployment and white-label solutions serve enterprise clients with specific requirements. Professional services and consulting provide high-margin revenue opportunities. The total addressable market exceeds 50 billion dollars when including adjacent markets like financial data and business intelligence."

# Segment 6: Competitive Advantages (2 minutes)
say -v Daniel -o ../demo-videos/demo-06-competitive-advantages.aiff "EconGraph has significant competitive advantages that create defensible market position. Our open-source foundation provides transparency and trust that proprietary solutions cannot match. The modern technology stack ensures superior performance and user experience compared to legacy systems. Cost advantages of 90 percent savings versus incumbents enable rapid market penetration. Our focus on user experience and modern design attracts younger analysts who will drive future purchasing decisions. The ability to customize and extend the platform provides sticky customer relationships. Strong community development model accelerates feature development and reduces costs."

# Segment 7: Roadmap & Growth Strategy (2 minutes)
say -v Daniel -o ../demo-videos/demo-07-roadmap-growth.aiff "Our roadmap positions EconGraph for explosive growth. Phase one introduces advanced machine learning features including Random Forest models for economic forecasting and anomaly detection. Phase two adds LSTM neural networks for sophisticated time series prediction and trend analysis. Phase three implements Global Economic Network analysis with clustering algorithms to identify economic relationships and contagion effects. Phase four brings AI-powered insights with natural language queries and automated report generation. Phase five adds enterprise features including single sign-on, comprehensive audit trails, and custom dashboard creation. Strategic partnerships with data providers expand our coverage while partnerships with financial institutions accelerate adoption."

# Segment 8: Investment Opportunity & Closing (1 minute)
say -v Daniel -o ../demo-videos/demo-08-investment-closing.aiff "We're seeking 2 million dollars in Series A funding for team expansion and accelerated feature development. This investment will fund hiring of senior engineers, data scientists, and business development professionals. The market opportunity is massive, our technology foundation is solid, and early traction validates product-market fit. We have a clear path to profitability within 18 months through enterprise licensing and premium subscriptions. Join us in democratizing economic intelligence and building the Bloomberg Terminal of the future. Thank you for your time, and I look forward to discussing this opportunity further."
