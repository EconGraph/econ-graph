# Segment 1: Opening & Market Analysis (4 minutes)
say -v Daniel -o ../demo-videos/full-demo-01-opening.aiff "Welcome to EconGraph - the future of economic intelligence platforms. I'm excited to present our comprehensive investor demonstration, showcasing not just our working prototype, but our complete vision for disrupting the economic data analytics market. Today, you'll see our technology in action, understand our business model, and discover why EconGraph represents a compelling investment opportunity. The global economic data analytics market is worth 8.2 billion dollars and growing at 15 percent annually. Current solutions like Bloomberg Terminal cost 24,000 dollars per year per seat, with limited customization and outdated user interfaces. Government agencies spend millions on economic monitoring systems. Financial institutions require real-time economic insights for trading and risk management. Research organizations and universities need affordable access to comprehensive economic data. We're not just building another data platform - we're democratizing economic intelligence for the world. Our open-source approach provides transparency, customization, and cost savings that proprietary solutions simply cannot match."

# Segment 2: Technology Deep Dive (4 minutes)
say -v Daniel -o ../demo-videos/full-demo-02-technology.aiff "Let me show you the robust technology foundation that sets EconGraph apart from legacy systems. We've built this on cutting-edge Rust backend for maximum performance and reliability. Rust provides memory safety, zero-cost abstractions, and blazing fast performance that's essential for processing massive economic datasets with millions of data points. Our modern React frontend with TypeScript delivers an enterprise-grade user experience that's both powerful and intuitive. The GraphQL API provides flexible data access and seamless integration capabilities for enterprise clients. PostgreSQL with advanced indexing ensures sub-second query performance even with decades of historical data. Our Kubernetes-ready architecture means infinite scalability with 99.9 percent uptime guarantees. Every component has been chosen for enterprise reliability and performance. The system handles real-time data ingestion, complex transformations, and interactive visualizations simultaneously. Our codebase has comprehensive test coverage with over 150 passing tests. The architecture supports horizontal scaling, load balancing, and distributed processing. This isn't just a prototype - it's production-ready infrastructure designed for enterprise deployment."

# Segment 3: Core Features Comprehensive Demo (5 minutes)
say -v Daniel -o ../demo-videos/full-demo-03-features.aiff "Now let me demonstrate our powerful search and visualization capabilities that solve real user problems. Watch as I search for any economic indicator - GDP, unemployment, inflation, trade data - with instant results and intelligent matching. Notice how our interactive charts provide hover tooltips showing exact values, dates, and complete revision history. This is crucial for economists who need to understand data quality and revisions over time. Our data transformations include Year-over-Year, Quarter-over-Quarter, and Month-over-Month growth calculations for comprehensive analysis. Pay special attention to how the Y-axis clearly shows the units being graphed - billions of dollars, percentages, index values - eliminating any confusion about what's being measured. Notice that clicking on any series link shows the correct data - we've eliminated the common problem where links show random or incorrect series. These may seem like small details, but they're critical for professional economic analysis and represent significant improvements over existing platforms. Multi-country comparisons allow global economic analysis with synchronized time scales and consistent formatting. Real-time data updates ensure you're always working with the latest information. The system supports complex queries, data filtering, and custom time ranges. Users can export data in multiple formats and access everything through our comprehensive API."

# Segment 4: Data Sources & Quality (3 minutes)
say -v Daniel -o ../demo-videos/full-demo-04-data-sources.aiff "Data quality and sourcing are fundamental to economic analysis, and EconGraph excels in both areas. We integrate with authoritative sources including FRED - the Federal Reserve Economic Data system, Bureau of Labor Statistics, Bureau of Economic Analysis, and international data providers like the OECD and World Bank. We provide comprehensive metadata including data quality indicators, revision tracking, source attribution, and update frequencies. Our system tracks original releases versus revised data, which is essential for understanding the evolution of economic statistics and making informed decisions. Historical data coverage goes back decades, providing the deep time series that economists need for proper trend analysis and forecasting. API access enables programmatic data retrieval for quantitative researchers, automated trading systems, and custom applications. Custom indicator creation allows users to build derived metrics specific to their analysis needs. The platform maintains data lineage, tracks revisions, and provides confidence intervals where available. We're continuously expanding our data coverage and improving quality through automated validation and expert review."

# Segment 5: Business Model & Market Strategy (2 minutes)
say -v Daniel -o ../demo-videos/full-demo-05-business-model.aiff "Our business model is designed for rapid growth and market penetration while maintaining healthy margins. We use a freemium model where core features are free, building a large user base and demonstrating value, while premium features drive revenue growth. Enterprise licenses cost just 2,400 dollars per year per seat - that's a 90 percent cost savings versus Bloomberg Terminal, making us incredibly competitive. Our target markets include financial institutions managing billions in assets, government agencies requiring economic monitoring, research organizations and universities with budget constraints, and consulting firms serving corporate clients. API access tiers provide additional revenue streams for developers and institutions requiring programmatic access. Custom deployment and white-label solutions serve enterprise clients with specific security and branding requirements."

# Segment 6: Competitive Advantages & Market Position (1.5 minutes)
say -v Daniel -o ../demo-videos/full-demo-06-competitive-advantages.aiff "EconGraph has significant competitive advantages that create a defensible market position. Our open-source foundation provides transparency and trust that proprietary solutions cannot match. The modern technology stack ensures superior performance and user experience compared to legacy systems built on outdated infrastructure. Cost advantages of 90 percent savings versus incumbents enable rapid market penetration and customer acquisition. Our focus on user experience and modern design attracts younger analysts who will drive future purchasing decisions. The ability to customize and extend the platform provides sticky customer relationships and reduces churn."

# Segment 7: Investment & Growth Strategy (0.5 minutes)
say -v Daniel -o ../demo-videos/full-demo-07-investment.aiff "We're seeking 2 million dollars in Series A funding for team expansion and accelerated feature development. This investment will fund hiring of senior engineers, data scientists, and business development professionals. The market opportunity is massive, our technology foundation is solid, and early traction validates product-market fit. We have a clear path to profitability within 18 months through enterprise licensing and premium subscriptions. Join us in democratizing economic intelligence and building the Bloomberg Terminal of the future. Thank you for your attention, and I look forward to discussing this exciting opportunity with you."
