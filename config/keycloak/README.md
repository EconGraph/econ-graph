# Keycloak realm `econ-graph`

Keycloak is EconGraph's identity provider. The realm is configuration as code:

| File | Used by | Contents |
|---|---|---|
| `econ-graph-realm.json` | docker-compose and k8s | Realm settings, clients, Google identity provider |
| `dev/econ-graph-users-0.json` | docker-compose only | Seeded test users. Never deployed |
| `qa/econ-graph-users-1.json` | `docker-compose.qa-users.yml` only | QA users `qa-alice`, `qa-bob`. Never deployed |

Keycloak imports the mounted files on first start (`--import-realm`). An existing realm is
not overwritten, so after editing a file, reset the realm by dropping Keycloak's
database volume and starting again:

```bash
docker compose rm -sf keycloak keycloak-db
docker volume rm "$(basename "$PWD")_keycloak_db_data"
docker compose up -d keycloak
```

## Local stack

```bash
docker compose up -d keycloak
scripts/keycloak/dev-token.sh alice   # prints iss, aud and sub of alice's access token
```

- Issuer: `http://localhost:8081/realms/econ-graph` (host port from `KEYCLOAK_PORT`)
- Admin console: <http://localhost:8081/admin>, user `admin`, password `admin`
  (override with `KEYCLOAK_ADMIN_USERNAME` / `KEYCLOAK_ADMIN_PASSWORD`)

### Test users

The release end-to-end suite depends on these. Keep the usernames, ids and
passwords stable: the ids are the tokens' `sub`, which becomes `users.id`.

| Username | Id (`sub`) | Password |
|---|---|---|
| `alice` | `0199a0e0-0000-7000-8000-00000000a11c` | `alice-dev-password` |
| `bob` | `0199a0e0-0000-7000-8000-000000000b0b` | `bob-dev-password` |
| `staff-admin` | `0199a0e0-0000-7000-8000-0000000005af` | `staff-admin-dev-password` |

Imported users get no default roles automatically, so each one lists
`default-roles-econ-graph`. Application roles arrive with the role catalog (AUTH-4);
until then the users differ only by name.

## Clients

- `econ-graph-web`: public client for the browser app. Authorization code with PKCE
  (S256 required). Exact redirect URIs `<origin>/auth/callback` and
  `<origin>/silent-callback.html`, post-logout redirect `<origin>/`, web origin
  `<origin>`, for each origin below. Access tokens carry `aud: econ-graph-api` through an audience mapper.
  The password grant is enabled only where `KC_WEB_DIRECT_GRANTS=true`, which only
  docker-compose sets, so scripts and tests can get tokens without a browser.
- `econ-graph-api`: bearer-only client representing the backend. It is the token
  audience and will own the fine-grained client roles.

## Placeholders

The realm file reads these environment variables when it is imported:

| Variable | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `KC_WEB_BASE_URL` | none (required) | Web app origin |
| `KC_WEB_E2E_BASE_URL` | none (required) | Second web origin: the release e2e frontend (`http://localhost:18081`) in compose, the same as `KC_WEB_BASE_URL` in k8s |
| `KC_WEB_DIRECT_GRANTS` | `false` | Password grant on `econ-graph-web` (dev only) |
| `KC_REALM_SSL_REQUIRED` | `external` | `none` in local compose |
| `KC_GOOGLE_ENABLED` | `false` | Set to `true` by the container command when both the Google client id and secret are configured |
| `KC_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`, `KC_GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` | `unset` | Google OAuth client |

Placeholders are resolved once, when the realm is first imported. After that the
values live in Keycloak's database, so a later change (for example a rotated Google
client secret) is made in the admin console, or locally by recreating the volume.

For Google sign-in locally, create an OAuth client in Google Cloud with redirect URI
`http://localhost:8081/realms/econ-graph/broker/google/endpoint`, then:

```bash
export KEYCLOAK_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=... KEYCLOAK_GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=...
docker compose up -d keycloak
```

## QA-only users

Two more realm-local users, `qa-alice` and `qa-bob` (passwords `qa-alice-password`
and `qa-bob-password`), live in `qa/econ-graph-users-1.json` for the release QA
suite to run a two-account check against a local compose stack. They are off by
default; opt in explicitly. Users are imported only on the realm's first start, so
reset the realm first (see above) if Keycloak has run before:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.qa-users.yml up -d keycloak
```

Never reference the dev or QA users, or `KC_WEB_DIRECT_GRANTS`, from k8s, deploy
scripts or terraform. `scripts/keycloak/check-no-dev-users-in-k8s.sh` (run in CI)
fails the build if they do. Real Google sign-in stays a manual QA step.

## Kubernetes

See `k8s/manifests/keycloak/` and the Keycloak section of `k8s/README.md`. The realm
file becomes the ConfigMap `keycloak-realm`; credentials live only in the Secret
`econ-graph-keycloak`, written by `scripts/deploy/create-secrets.sh`.
