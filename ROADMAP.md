## 🛠️ **Technical Implementation Ideas**

### 🤖 **Machine Learning Stack**
```rust
// Future ML integration ideas
use candle_core::{Device, Tensor};
use candle_nn::{linear, Module};

// LSTM implementation for economic forecasting
struct EconomicLSTM {
    lstm: candle_nn::LSTM,
    output_layer: Linear,
}

// Random Forest for indicator prediction
struct EconomicRandomForest {
    trees: Vec<DecisionTree>,
    feature_importance: HashMap<String, f64>,
}
```

### 📊 **Advanced Analytics**
```typescript
// React components for ML results
interface MLPrediction {
  indicator: string;
  prediction: number[];
  confidence: number;
  model_type: 'lstm' | 'random_forest' | 'regression';
}

const PredictionChart: React.FC<{
  predictions: MLPrediction[];
}> = ({ predictions }) => {
  // Visualization of ML predictions
};
```

### 🌍 **Geographic Visualization**

// D3.js world map integration
import * as d3 from 'd3';
import { geoPath, geoNaturalEarth1 } from 'd3-geo';

const WorldMap: React.FC = () => {
  // Interactive world map with economic data overlay
};
```
