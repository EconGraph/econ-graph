# EconGraph Kubernetes Deployment

This directory contains all the necessary files to deploy EconGraph to a local Kubernetes cluster using Terraform and kind (Kubernetes in Docker).

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Docker
- Terraform
- kubectl
- kind (will be installed automatically)

### One-Command Setup

```bash
./scripts/deploy/setup-local-k8s.sh
```

This script will:

1. Create a local Kubernetes cluster using Terraform
2. Build Docker images for frontend and backend
3. Deploy the application to the cluster
4. Set up ingress and services

## 🛠️ Manual Setup

If you prefer to run each step manually:

### 1. Create Kubernetes Cluster

```bash
cd terraform/k8s
terraform init
terraform apply
```

### 2. Build Docker Images

```bash
./scripts/deploy/build-images.sh
```

### 3. Deploy Application

```bash
./scripts/deploy/deploy.sh
```

## 🔐 Keycloak

`scripts/deploy/deploy.sh` deploys Keycloak from `k8s/manifests/keycloak/` (its own
Postgres, then Keycloak with the `econ-graph` realm from `config/keycloak/`). Its
credentials are never committed: they live in the Secret `econ-graph-keycloak`,
written by `scripts/deploy/create-secrets.sh` (from the secrets PR, which also makes
`deploy.sh` run it). That script generates the admin and database passwords on its
first run and keeps them afterwards. `deploy.sh` skips Keycloak while the Secret
does not exist.

```bash
# Optional, for Google sign-in (redirect URI https://<PUBLIC_HOST>/idp/realms/econ-graph/broker/google/endpoint,
# or http://localhost/idp/... without a PUBLIC_HOST):
export KEYCLOAK_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=... KEYCLOAK_GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=...
./scripts/deploy/create-secrets.sh
./scripts/deploy/deploy.sh
```

- Issuer: `http://localhost/idp/realms/econ-graph`, or `https://<PUBLIC_HOST>/idp/realms/econ-graph`
  with a public host (see [Public site](#-public-site-cloudflare-tunnel)). Only `/idp/realms/econ-graph`
  and `/idp/resources` are routed by the ingress; the master realm is not reachable
  from outside the cluster.
- Admin console: `kubectl -n econ-graph port-forward svc/keycloak-service 18080:8080`,
  then <http://localhost:18080/idp/admin>. The password is in the Secret:
  `kubectl -n econ-graph get secret econ-graph-keycloak -o jsonpath='{.data.admin-password}' | base64 -d`
- Every deploy re-applies `config/keycloak/econ-graph-realm.json` through the Job
  `keycloak-realm-import` (keycloak-config-cli), so the realm, its roles and the
  Google client follow the repository. Users and their role assignments are kept.
  Logs: `kubectl -n econ-graph logs job/keycloak-realm-import -c keycloak-config-cli`.
- Seeded test users exist only in the local docker-compose stack, never in the cluster.

## 🌐 Accessing the Application

After deployment, the application will be available at:

- **Frontend**: <http://localhost>
- **Backend API**: <http://localhost/api>
- **GraphQL**: <http://localhost/graphql>
- **Health Check**: <http://localhost/health>

**Note**: `k8s/manifests/ingress.yaml` and `k8s/manifests/keycloak/ingress.yaml` route on
`host: localhost`, so no `/etc/hosts` entry is needed. The admin frontend isn't deployed by
`deploy.sh` (re-enabled by ECO-242, train 2); `/admin` has no backend until then.

## 🌍 Public site (Cloudflare Tunnel)

Production is served at <https://econgraph.com> (no hyphen) through a Cloudflare Tunnel:

```text
browser --https--> Cloudflare edge --tunnel--> cloudflared (pod) --http--> ingress-nginx --> app, Keycloak
```

TLS ends at Cloudflare. The `cloudflared` Deployment (`k8s/manifests/cloudflared.yaml`)
dials out to Cloudflare, so no port is opened on the host, and it runs in the cluster, so it
comes back with the cluster after a reboot or a recreate.

**The host name is one setting, `PUBLIC_HOST`.** `deploy.sh` applies it through
`scripts/deploy/render-public-host.py`, which adds to the committed localhost-only manifests
(`http://localhost` keeps working on the host):

| What | Value for `PUBLIC_HOST=econgraph.com` |
| --- | --- |
| Ingress hosts (app, `/graphql`, Keycloak) | `econgraph.com`, as well as `localhost` |
| `www.econgraph.com` | permanent redirect to `https://econgraph.com`, same path (ingress-nginx `from-to-www-redirect`) |
| Keycloak `KC_HOSTNAME` | `https://econgraph.com/idp`; the admin console stays on the port-forward (`KC_HOSTNAME_ADMIN`) |
| Realm client `econ-graph-web` | redirect URIs and web origins for `https://econgraph.com` and `http://localhost` |
| Backend `OIDC_ISSUER` | `https://econgraph.com/idp/realms/econ-graph`; the signing keys are still fetched in-cluster (`OIDC_JWKS_URL`) |
| Backend `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` | `https://econgraph.com` added to `http://localhost,http://localhost:3000` |
| ingress-nginx | client address from `CF-Connecting-IP` (trusted only from pod addresses) and scheme from `X-Forwarded-Proto`, so per-client rate limits and Keycloak see the visitor and https |

The frontend image needs no rebuild per host: `build-images.sh` builds it with the issuer
`/idp/realms/econ-graph`, which the app resolves against the page's origin at runtime.
Images built before ECO-457 have an absolute issuer baked in; rebuild them once.

www is redirected rather than served because sign-in uses one Keycloak issuer that the
backend checks exactly; a second origin would need its own redirect URIs, web origins and
CORS entry, and would split sessions between hosts.

**Tunnel token.** The token is the Secret `cloudflare-tunnel` (key `token`). Enter it
yourself with hidden input; it is never committed, printed, or given to an agent:

```bash
scripts/deploy/set-crawler-keys.sh --tunnel
```

(or `CLOUDFLARE_TUNNEL_TOKEN=... scripts/deploy/create-secrets.sh`). Without the Secret,
`deploy.sh` applies `cloudflared` with 0 replicas and says so.

**Cloudflare dashboard** (Zero Trust > Networks > Tunnels > the tunnel > Public hostnames),
one entry per host name:

| Subdomain | Domain | Path | Service type | URL |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| (empty) | `econgraph.com` | (empty) | `HTTP` | `ingress-nginx-controller.ingress-nginx.svc.cluster.local:80` |
| `www` | `econgraph.com` | (empty) | `HTTP` | `ingress-nginx-controller.ingress-nginx.svc.cluster.local:80` |

Leave *Additional application settings > HTTP Settings > HTTP Host Header* empty: cloudflared
then sends the visitor's host (`econgraph.com` or `www.econgraph.com`), which is what the
ingress rules match on. Leave *No TLS Verify* and *Origin Server Name* alone (the origin is
plain HTTP). When ingress-nginx gives way to the Gateway API (ECO-433), the service URL
changes to the Gateway's Service.

**Checks.** `scripts/deploy/check-public-site.sh --host econgraph.com` checks the frontend, a
`/graphql` search, the Keycloak discovery document (issuer
`https://econgraph.com/idp/realms/econ-graph`), the sign-in page, CORS and the www redirect
against the local ingress, without DNS or the tunnel. Add `--via-cloudflare` to go through
Cloudflare the way a visitor does. Prometheus alerts `CloudflareTunnelDown` and
`CloudflareTunnelNoConnections` (`k8s/monitoring/prometheus-rules-tunnel.yaml`) cover the
connector.

**Google sign-in** needs `https://econgraph.com/idp/realms/econ-graph/broker/google/endpoint`
as an authorized redirect URI of the Google OAuth client (ECO-13).

## 🔧 Configuration

### Environment Variables

The application is configured via ConfigMap and Secrets:

- **ConfigMap**: Contains non-sensitive configuration
- **Secrets**: Store credentials outside the manifests. Current manifests contain no credentials; Google and Facebook credentials committed before #227 remain in Git history and must be rotated. See [Secrets](#secrets)

### Database Connection

PostgreSQL runs in the cluster (`postgres-deployment.yaml`). The backend and crawler-worker connect as the
`econgraph` user through `DATABASE_URL`, which `create-secrets.sh` builds and stores in the
`econ-graph-secrets` Secret.

### Secrets

Current manifests contain no credentials. Google and Facebook credentials committed before #227 remain in Git history and must be rotated. `scripts/deploy/create-secrets.sh` creates the Secrets below in the
`econ-graph` namespace from environment variables; `deploy.sh` runs it on every deploy. It is
idempotent: internal passwords are generated with `openssl rand` on the first run and kept on
later runs, optional keys that are unset keep their current value (or are omitted), and obvious
placeholders such as `password` or `your-...` are refused. A variable set to the empty string
counts as unset.

```bash
FRED_API_KEY=... ./scripts/deploy/create-secrets.sh
kubectl -n econ-graph rollout restart deployment/econ-graph-backend deployment/crawler-worker
```

| Secret | Keys (environment variable) | Used by |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `econ-graph-secrets` | `database-url` (built from `app-password`); the retired in-house login keys (`jwt-secret`, `google-*`, `facebook-*`) are removed if an older run left them | backend, crawler-worker (`database-url`) |
| `econ-graph-postgres` | `postgres-password` (`POSTGRES_PASSWORD`, generated), `app-password` (`APP_DB_PASSWORD`, generated) | postgres, its init script |
| `crawler-api-keys` | optional `fred-api-key`, `bls-api-key`, `bea-api-key`, `census-api-key` (`FRED_API_KEY`, ...) | crawler-worker |
| `econ-graph-keycloak` | `admin-username`, `admin-password`, `db-password`, optional `google-idp-client-id`, `google-idp-client-secret` (`KEYCLOAK_*`); the passwords are generated on the first run, the username defaults to `admin` | Keycloak (manifests arrive with the Keycloak deploy PR) |
| `grafana-admin` | `admin-password` (`GRAFANA_ADMIN_PASSWORD`, generated) | Grafana (user `admin`) |
| `monitoring-auth` | `auth`, one htpasswd line (`MONITORING_BASIC_AUTH`, e.g. `htpasswd -nB admin`, which prompts); only written when set | `ingress-cloudflare-dns01.yaml` basic auth |
| `cloudflare-tunnel` | optional `token` (`CLOUDFLARE_TUNNEL_TOKEN`), the Cloudflare Tunnel connector token | `cloudflared` (see [Public site](#-public-site-cloudflare-tunnel)) |

Read a value back with, for example:

```bash
kubectl -n econ-graph get secret grafana-admin -o jsonpath='{.data.admin-password}' | base64 -d
```

Postgres and Grafana read their passwords only when their data volume is first initialised.
Changing `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`, `APP_DB_PASSWORD` or `GRAFANA_ADMIN_PASSWORD` later updates the
Secret but not the running service; also change the password there (for example
`ALTER ROLE econgraph PASSWORD ...` in psql). A Postgres volume created before these Secrets
existed has tables owned by `postgres` and an `econgraph` password that no longer matches: for a
local cluster, recreate it (`./scripts/deploy/teardown.sh`, then deploy again); to keep the data,
dump it with `pg_dump --no-owner` and restore it as `econgraph` into a fresh volume.
`create-secrets.sh` stops when it finds such a volume (a `postgresql-data-postgresql-*` PVC) but no
`econ-graph-postgres` Secret; set `ALLOW_EXISTING_DB_VOLUME=1` to continue anyway. It also stops,
without writing anything, when it cannot query the cluster.

#### Upgrading a cluster deployed before these Secrets

Older deploys used committed credentials for Grafana and for the monitoring basic auth, and both
survive a redeploy: Grafana keeps its admin password on its volume, and the old `monitoring-auth`
Secret is never deleted by `kubectl apply`. Replace both; `create-secrets.sh` stops until you do.

```bash
# Grafana: choose a password, store it in grafana-admin, and set it in Grafana.
export GRAFANA_ADMIN_PASSWORD="$(openssl rand -hex 32)"
printf '%s' "$GRAFANA_ADMIN_PASSWORD" |
  kubectl -n econ-graph exec -i grafana-0 -- grafana cli admin reset-admin-password --password-from-stdin
# Monitoring basic auth: a new htpasswd line replaces the committed one.
export MONITORING_BASIC_AUTH="$(htpasswd -nB admin)"  # prompts for the password
./scripts/deploy/create-secrets.sh
```

If you already replaced them another way, run the script once with
`ALLOW_EXISTING_GRAFANA_VOLUME=1` or `ALLOW_MANIFEST_MONITORING_AUTH=1` to skip the check;
later runs don't need them.

Without `monitoring-auth`, the monitoring host in `ingress-cloudflare-dns01.yaml` returns 503
until the Secret exists; `create-secrets.sh` warns when `MONITORING_BASIC_AUTH` is unset and the
Secret is missing.

## 🗑️ Cleanup

### Remove Application Only

```bash
./scripts/deploy/teardown.sh
```

### Remove Entire Cluster

```bash
kind delete cluster --name econ-graph
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Images not found**: Make sure you've built the images with `./scripts/deploy/build-images.sh`

2. **Database connection failed**: Ensure PostgreSQL is running and accessible

3. **Pods not starting**: Check logs with `kubectl logs <pod-name> -n econ-graph`

4. **Ingress not working**: Verify NGINX ingress controller is running:

   ```bash
   kubectl get pods -n ingress-nginx
   ```

### Debug Commands

```bash
# Describe a pod to see events
kubectl describe pod <pod-name> -n econ-graph

# Check cluster info
kubectl cluster-info

# Check node status
kubectl get nodes

# Check ingress status
kubectl get ingress -n econ-graph
```

## 📈 Performance Tuning

### Resource Limits

The deployments include resource requests and limits. Adjust these in the deployment manifests based on your needs:

```yaml
resources:
  requests:
    memory: "256Mi"
    cpu: "100m"
  limits:
    memory: "512Mi"
    cpu: "500m"
```

### Scaling

For production use, consider:

- Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA)
- Vertical Pod Autoscaler (VPA)
- Cluster Autoscaler

## 🔒 Security

### Current Security Measures

- Non-root containers
- Resource limits
- Health checks
- Security headers (frontend)

### Production Recommendations

- Use proper secrets management (e.g., HashiCorp Vault)
- Enable network policies
- Use TLS certificates
- Regular security scanning
- RBAC configuration
