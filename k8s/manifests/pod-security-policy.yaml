# PodSecurityPolicy has been deprecated and removed in Kubernetes 1.25+
# This file is replaced with Pod Security Standards using namespace labels
# For Kubernetes 1.25+, use Pod Security Admission instead

---
# Update the existing econ-graph namespace with Pod Security Standards
apiVersion: v1
kind: Namespace
metadata:
  name: econ-graph
  labels:
    # Enforce "restricted" Pod Security Standard
    # This is equivalent to the old PSP with privileged: false, etc.
    pod-security.kubernetes.io/enforce: restricted
    pod-security.kubernetes.io/audit: restricted
    pod-security.kubernetes.io/warn: restricted

# Alternative: If you need more granular control, you can create a PodSecurityPolicy-like
# configuration using Pod Security Standards with custom ValidatingAdmissionPolicy
# This is for reference - the namespace labels above should be sufficient for most use cases
