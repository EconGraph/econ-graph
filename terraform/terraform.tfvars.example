# ADMIN INTERFACE CONFIGURATION
# =============================
# SECURITY WARNING: Admin interface provides full system control
# Only configure if you need administrative access

# REQUIRED: Admin domain (use internal domain, not public)
admin_domain = "admin.internal.econgraph.example.com"

# REQUIRED: Admin access control (IP whitelist)
allowed_admin_ips = [
  "10.0.0.0/8",      # Internal network
  "172.16.0.0/12",   # Private network
  "192.168.0.0/16",  # Local network
  # Add your specific admin IP ranges here
]

# REQUIRED: Admin authentication secrets (generate strong random values)
admin_jwt_secret     = "your-admin-jwt-secret-256-bits"
admin_session_key    = "your-admin-session-key-256-bits"
admin_encryption_key = "your-admin-encryption-key-256-bits"

# REQUIRED: Admin TLS certificates (base64 encoded)
# admin_tls_cert = "base64-encoded-certificate"
# admin_tls_key  = "base64-encoded-private-key"

# Admin security settings
admin_session_timeout = 1800  # 30 minutes
admin_mfa_required    = true
admin_alert_email     = "admin@example.com"

# Admin resource limits
admin_replica_count   = 2

admin_memory_limit    = "512Mi"

# Admin rate limiting
admin_rate_limit_rps         = 10
admin_rate_limit_connections = 5

# SECURITY NOTES:
# 1. Admin interface is deployed in separate namespace with network isolation
# 2. Access is restricted to specified IP ranges only
# 3. All admin actions are logged and monitored
# 4. Use strong, unique secrets for admin authentication
# 5. Consider using VPN or bastion host for additional security
