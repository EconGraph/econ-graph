# CI/CD Workflows

This directory contains the CI/CD workflows for the EconGraph project, cleaned up and optimized for better maintainability and reduced costs.

## Active Workflow Files

### Core Tests (`ci-core.yml`) - **PRIMARY WORKFLOW**
**Purpose**: Comprehensive testing that runs on every commit
- 20+ parallel backend test jobs covering all service layers
- Admin Frontend tests (runs in parallel, doesn't gate other tests)
- Frontend tests, quality checks, security audits, and E2E tests
- All essential functionality validation

**Triggers**: Push to main/develop/`release/**` (REL-6: a release branch gets CI on every merge into it, same as main), every PR whatever its base branch (so stacked PRs are tested before they are retargeted), manual dispatch. Changes only to top-level Markdown files, `docs/**`, `LICENSE` or `.gitignore` don't run it.

**Concurrency**: one run per PR. A push cancels the run the previous push started, so review rounds don't pile up in the queue. Runs on main and develop are never cancelled.

**Path filters** (`changes` job): a PR that touches only `frontend/` or `admin-frontend/` skips the backend build and the test jobs that depend on it (Quality Checks still runs); one that touches only `backend/` or `chart-api-service/` skips the frontend test jobs. Shared paths (`.github/`, `ci/`, `scripts/`, `config/keycloak/`, `docker-compose.yml`, `package.json`, `k8s/`, `terraform/`, the committed GraphQL `schema.graphql`, since Frontend Tests checks every frontend operation against it, and the backend and frontend Dockerfiles and `.dockerignore` files) run both sides, and pushes to main run every job that isn't gated to a manual run (Admin Frontend Tests and the E2E jobs).

Four more jobs run on a PR only when the files they check changed (or when `ci-core.yml` itself changed), and always on a push to main or a manual run: Security Audit and License Compliance Check (Cargo manifests, npm manifests and lockfiles, `deny.toml`, the audit and license-checker config), Docker Build Test (the backend and frontend Dockerfiles, `.dockerignore` and `nginx.conf` files, which also count as shared paths so the backend build it needs runs too, plus the Cargo/npm manifests and `rust-toolchain.toml` it builds against, since a dependency or toolchain bump can break the image with no Dockerfile touched) and Backend Migration Validation Tests (`backend/migrations/`, the check script).

### Security (`security.yml`)
**Purpose**: Daily security vulnerability scanning
- Rust and NPM security audits
- License compliance checking

**Triggers**: Daily at 2 AM UTC, manual dispatch

### Crawler Integration Test (`crawler-integration-test.yml`)
**Purpose**: Manual testing of data crawler functionality
- Tests specific data source crawling
- Validates migration generation

**Triggers**: Manual dispatch only

### Admin Frontend Tests (`admin-frontend-tests.yml`)
**Purpose**: Comprehensive testing of the admin frontend interface
- Unit tests, integration tests, and E2E tests for admin UI
- Build verification and quality checks
- Runs independently and doesn't gate other workflows

**Triggers**: Push/PR to admin-frontend, manual dispatch

### Playwright Tests (`playwright-tests*.yml`)
**Purpose**: End-to-end testing on version releases
- Comprehensive E2E testing
- Mobile and desktop browser testing

**Triggers**: Version tags (v*)

## Manual-Only Workflows

### Experimental (`ci-experimental.yml`)
**Purpose**: Performance testing and experimental features
**Status**: Manual dispatch only

### RAM Disk Build Cache (`ramdisk-build-cache.yml`)
**Purpose**: Build performance optimization testing
**Status**: Manual dispatch only

## Workflow Dependencies

```
Core Tests (ci-core.yml)
├── backend-smoke-tests
├── admin-frontend-tests (parallel, non-gating)
├── backend-database-tests (needs: backend-smoke-tests)
├── backend-service-tests (needs: backend-smoke-tests)
├── frontend-tests
└── quality-checks
```

## Environment Variables

All workflows share these environment variables:
- `CARGO_TERM_COLOR: always` - Colored Rust output
- `DATABASE_URL: postgresql://postgres:password@localhost:5432/econ_graph_test` - Test database connection

## Database Configuration

All CI workflows now use **PostgreSQL 18** with the following benefits:
- **UUIDv7 Support**: Native UUIDv7 generation with `uuidv7()` function
- **Performance**: Better performance for UUID-based primary keys
- **Future-Proof**: Latest PostgreSQL features and optimizations
- **Consistency**: All test environments use the same PostgreSQL version

## Benefits of This Structure

1. **Easier to Understand**: Each workflow has a clear, focused purpose
2. **Faster Feedback**: Core tests run independently and provide quick feedback
3. **Better Debugging**: Issues are isolated to specific workflow files
4. **Selective Running**: You can run specific types of tests manually
5. **Maintainable**: Smaller files are easier to modify and review

## Running Workflows

### Automatic Triggers
- **Push to main/develop**: All workflows run automatically
- **Pull Requests**: All workflows run automatically

### Manual Triggers
- **Core Tests**: `gh workflow run ci-core.yml`
- **Admin Frontend Tests**: `gh workflow run admin-frontend-tests.yml`
- **Security Checks**: `gh workflow run security.yml`
- **Crawler Integration**: `gh workflow run crawler-integration-test.yml`
- **Experimental**: `gh workflow run ci-experimental.yml --field experiment=ramdisk`
- **RAM Disk Cache**: `gh workflow run ramdisk-build-cache.yml`

## Cleanup Summary

- **Removed broken workflows** (ci-build.yml, ci-integration.yml, ci-security.yml) that had no active triggers
- **Removed 9 experimental test workflows** that were disabled and causing confusion
- **Removed backup and disabled workflow files** that were no longer needed
- **Cleaned up excessive CI infrastructure** including unused scripts and documentation
- **Consolidated to essential workflows** with clear purposes and triggers
- **Maintained full test coverage** through the primary ci-core.yml workflow

## Cost Optimization

This cleanup eliminates:
- Dead workflows that could trigger accidentally
- Redundant CI infrastructure and documentation
- Confusion about which workflows are active
- Potential costs from unused or experimental workflows

The remaining workflows provide comprehensive testing while being clearly organized and cost-effective.

## Workflow Validation

### Automated Validation Script

Use the `ci/scripts/validate-ci-workflows.sh` script to validate all GitHub Actions CI/CD workflows before committing changes:

```bash
# Run CI/CD workflow validation
./ci/scripts/validate-ci-workflows.sh
```

### Validation Checks

The script performs the following checks:

1. **YAML Syntax Validation**: Ensures all workflow files have valid YAML syntax
2. **Job Structure Validation**: Verifies all jobs have proper `steps` sections
3. **Orphaned Workflow Detection**: Identifies workflows with no active triggers
4. **Naming Consistency**: Ensures workflows have descriptive names

### Integration

- **Pre-commit**: Run validation before committing workflow changes
- **CI Pipeline**: Validation is integrated into the main CI pipeline
- **Error Reporting**: Provides clear, actionable error messages with color-coded output

### Common Issues Detected

- **Invalid Job Definitions**: Jobs without `steps` sections (causes 0s duration failures)
- **Orphaned Workflows**: Workflows from deleted branches showing as active in GitHub
- **Malformed YAML**: Syntax errors that prevent workflow parsing
- **Missing Triggers**: Workflows that can't be executed
- **Poor Naming**: Workflows without descriptive names

### Example Output

```bash
🔍 Validating GitHub Actions CI/CD workflows...
📋 Checking YAML syntax...
✅ ci-core.yml - Valid YAML syntax
❌ ci-core.yml - Job structure issues found
⚠️  experimental.yml - No active triggers (may be orphaned)
📊 Validation Summary:
❌ Found 1 validation errors
💡 Fix the errors above before committing workflow changes
