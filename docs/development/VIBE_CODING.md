```typescript
// Relevance scoring algorithm
const calculateRelevanceScore = (series, query) => {
  if (title.includes(query)) return title === query ? 100 : 95;
  if (description.includes(query)) return 88;
  if (source.includes(query)) return 75;
}

// Enhanced pagination with proper formatting  
showing {((currentPage - 1) * 50) + 1}-{Math.min(currentPage * 50, filteredSeries.length)} of {filteredSeries.length} results

- ✅ **Directory Organization**: Created separate directories for specialized test categories
- ✅ **CI Pipeline Optimization**: Added parallel execution for specialized test suites
- ✅ **Configuration Updates**: Created dedicated Playwright configs for each test suite
- ✅ **Comprehensive Test Exclusion**: Fixed comprehensive tests to exclude specialized suites

**Technical Achievement**:
- **Test Organization**: Separated tests into focused, maintainable suites:
  - Core tests: Basic functionality (navigation, authentication, dashboard)
  - Global Analysis tests: World map, country selection, economic indicators (162 tests)
  - Professional Analysis tests: Advanced charting, technical indicators (39 tests)
  - Mobile versions: Separate mobile test suites for each category
  - Comprehensive tests: Integration/workflow tests (now properly focused)
- **Parallel CI Execution**: All test suites now run in parallel for faster feedback
- **Test Isolation**: Each suite can be run independently for faster debugging
- **Configuration Consistency**: All configs follow the same patterns as existing core configs

**Test Suite Structure**:
```
frontend/tests/e2e/
├── core/                    # Basic functionality tests
├── global-analysis/         # Global analysis features (5 files, 162 tests)
├── professional-analysis/   # Professional analysis features (1 file, 39 tests)
├── comprehensive/           # Integration/workflow tests (empty, focused)
└── [other test files]      # Individual test files
```

**CI Pipeline Jobs**:
- `e2e-core-tests`: Basic functionality tests
