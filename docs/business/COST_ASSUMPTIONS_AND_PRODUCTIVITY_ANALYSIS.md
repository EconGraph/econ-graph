### 2. Optimistic Estimates
- Use AI-assisted development multipliers
- Consider 10-20x productivity gains
- Factor in reduced learning curve time

### 3. Realistic Project Planning
- Start with AI-assisted development
- Fall back to traditional development for complex features
- Hybrid approach for optimal cost-benefit ratio
