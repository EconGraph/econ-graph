# Backend Federation Quality Improvements

## Overview

This PR implements the quality improvement plan for the financial data service, focusing on production readiness, code coverage, and system reliability.

## Base Branch

**Base**: `backend-federation-architecture`  
**Target**: Production-ready financial data service

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Critical Fixes (Week 1-2)
- [ ] **File System Safety**
  - Implement file locking in `FileCatalog` operations
  - Add atomic catalog updates (write to temp, then rename)
  - Add checksum validation for file integrity

- [ ] **Memory Management**
  - Implement streaming catalog loading for large datasets
  - Add LRU cache for frequently accessed series
  - Add memory usage monitoring and limits

- [ ] **Data Validation**
  - Add JSON schema validation for series metadata
  - Implement data type validation for all fields
  - Add input sanitization and rate limiting

### Phase 2: Coverage & Quality (Week 3-4)
- [ ] **Coverage Infrastructure**
  - Set 80% minimum coverage thresholds
  - Add coverage badges to README
  - Integrate coverage reports with PR reviews

- [ ] **Test Enhancement**
  - Add concurrent access testing
  - Add error recovery testing
  - Add performance testing for large datasets

### Phase 3: Production Hardening (Week 5-6)
- [ ] **Performance Optimization**
  - Implement connection pooling
  - Add intelligent caching strategies
  - Optimize file I/O patterns

- [ ] **Monitoring & Observability**
  - Add catalog health endpoints
  - Set up alerting for catalog corruption
  - Track performance metrics

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Overall code coverage > 80%
- [ ] Zero data corruption incidents
- [ ] < 100ms average catalog query time
- [ ] < 100MB memory usage for 1,000 series
- [ ] 99.9% uptime for catalog operations

## Risk Mitigation

This PR addresses critical production risks identified in the quality assessment:
- File system race conditions
- Memory management with large datasets
- Error recovery and consistency
- Data validation gaps

## Testing Strategy

- Comprehensive concurrent access tests
- Error recovery scenario testing
- Performance benchmarking
- Memory usage validation
- Integration with existing test suite
