# EDGAR XBRL Research Findings

## Executive Summary

Based on initial research into SEC EDGAR XBRL data structure and the `crabrl` Rust parser, this project shows **high potential** but requires careful validation of technical feasibility.

## XBRL Structure Analysis

### What I Discovered

**File Structure (from Apple's 10-Q sample):**
- **Main XBRL file**: `aapl-20231230.htm` (732KB) - HTML with embedded XBRL tags
- **Schema file**: `aapl-20231230.xsd` (33KB) - Defines data structure and relationships
- **Linkbase files**:
  - `aapl-20231230_cal.xml` (79KB) - Calculation relationships
  - `aapl-20231230_def.xml` (152KB) - Definition relationships  
  - `aapl-20231230_lab.xml` (534KB) - Labels and descriptions
  - `aapl-20231230_pre.xml` (315KB) - Presentation relationships

**Key Observations:**
1. **Complexity is real** - XBRL files are indeed extremely complex with multiple interconnected files
2. **Standardized structure** - Uses US-GAAP taxonomy with company-specific extensions
3. **Rich metadata** - Contains detailed financial data with context, units, and relationships
4. **File sizes** - Single 10-Q filing generates ~2MB of XBRL data across multiple files

### High-Level Structure (2-3 levels deep only)

## Crabrl Parser Analysis

### Crate Information
- **Name**: `crabrl`
- **Version**: 0.1.0 (very new - published August 2025)
- **License**: AGPL-3.0 (restrictive commercial license)
- **Downloads**: 262 (very low adoption)
- **Author**: Stefano Amorelli
- **Repository**: https://github.com/stefanoamorelli/crabrl

### Key Features
- **High-performance XBRL parser and validator**
- **Keywords**: parser, finance, xbrl, sec, edgar
- **Features**: CLI support, parallel processing, memory mapping
- **Dependencies**: Uses `clap`, `colored`, `memmap2`, `rayon`

### Concerns Identified

1. **License Issue**: AGPL-3.0 is problematic for commercial use
   - Requires open-sourcing derivative works
   - May not be suitable for a commercial product

2. **Very New**: Published only 3 months ago
   - Limited adoption and testing
   - Potential stability issues
   - Small community support

3. **Limited Documentation**: No documentation URL provided
   - Unclear API and capabilities
   - No usage examples readily available

## Alternative XBRL Parsers Research

### Python Options
- **pyxbrl**: Mature Python XBRL parser
- **edgartools**: Specifically for EDGAR filings
- **xbrl-us**: US-GAAP specific parser

### Java Options
- **Arelle**: Open source XBRL platform
- **XBRL.org tools**: Official XBRL utilities

### Rust Alternatives
- **Limited options**: Only 2 XBRL-related crates on crates.io
- **crabrl** appears to be the only serious Rust XBRL parser

## Technical Feasibility Assessment

### ‚úÖ Positive Indicators

1. **Data Availability**: SEC EDGAR provides free, comprehensive XBRL data
2. **Standardized Format**: US-GAAP taxonomy provides consistency
3. **Rich Financial Data**: Contains detailed balance sheets, income statements, cash flows
4. **Real-time Updates**: New filings appear within 4 hours
5. **No Authentication**: Free access without API keys

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Challenges Identified

1. **XBRL Complexity**: Files are extremely complex with multiple interlinked documents
2. **Parser Limitations**: `crabrl` has licensing and maturity concerns
3. **Data Quality**: Companies may report inconsistently or with errors
4. **Scale**: Processing thousands of filings with complex XBRL data
5. **Taxonomy Evolution**: US-GAAP taxonomy changes annually

### üîç Technical Risks

1. **Parser Reliability**: `crabrl` is too new to trust for production use
2. **License Compatibility**: AGPL-3.0 may prevent commercial deployment
3. **Performance**: XBRL parsing is computationally intensive
4. **Data Validation**: Need robust validation for financial accuracy
5. **Maintenance**: XBRL specifications evolve frequently

## Recommendations

### Phase 1: Proof of Concept (Recommended)
1. **Test `crabrl` with real data** to validate functionality
2. **Evaluate license implications** for commercial use
3. **Assess parsing performance** with sample filings
4. **Compare with Python alternatives** for feasibility

### Phase 2: Alternative Approaches
1. **Consider Python integration** using `pyxbrl` or `edgartools`
2. **Evaluate hybrid approach** - Python for parsing, Rust for API
3. **Investigate commercial XBRL parsers** if budget allows

### Phase 3: Production Considerations
1. **Build robust error handling** for malformed XBRL files
2. **Implement data validation** against accounting principles
3. **Create caching strategy** for frequently accessed data
4. **Plan for taxonomy updates** and schema evolution

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions
1. **Test `crabrl` parser** with downloaded Apple XBRL files
2. **Research license alternatives** or workarounds
3. **Evaluate Python parser options** as backup plan
4. **Create simple proof-of-concept** to validate approach

### Research Questions
1. Can `crabrl` handle real EDGAR XBRL files successfully?
2. What are the performance characteristics for parsing?
3. How accurate is the extracted financial data?
4. What are the licensing implications for commercial use?
