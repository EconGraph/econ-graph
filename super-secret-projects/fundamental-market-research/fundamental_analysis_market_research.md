# Fundamental Analysis Market Research
## Strategic Market Analysis for XBRL-Based Financial Data Platform

*Last Updated: September 14, 2025*

### Executive Summary

This document provides comprehensive market research for developing an XBRL-based fundamental analysis platform targeting sophisticated retail investors and smaller investment funds. Our goal is to understand the competitive landscape, identify market opportunities, and validate the business case for a platform that leverages SEC EDGAR XBRL data to provide institutional-quality fundamental analysis at retail-accessible pricing.

### Strategic Context

**The Opportunity**: Traditional fundamental analysis platforms (Bloomberg Terminal, FactSet, etc.) cost $10,000-$30,000+ annually per user, pricing out sophisticated retail investors and smaller funds. Meanwhile, the SEC's mandatory XBRL filings provide a rich, standardized dataset of fundamental financial data that remains largely underutilized by retail-focused platforms.

**Our Hypothesis**: There exists a significant market opportunity to build a platform that:
- Extracts and processes SEC EDGAR XBRL data automatically
- Provides institutional-quality fundamental analysis tools
- Targets the underserved "sophisticated retail" and "small fund" segments
- Competes on features and data quality rather than just price

**Research Objectives**:
1. Map the current competitive landscape and pricing models
2. Identify successful platforms targeting similar segments
3. Analyze funding patterns and growth metrics of comparable companies
4. Understand user needs and feature gaps in existing solutions
5. Validate market size and opportunity for XBRL-based approach

### Research Scope
- **Overall Market**: Fundamental data analysis tools for traditional equity analysis
- **Target Segment**: Sophisticated retail investors and smaller funds ($10K-$500K AUM)
- **Exclude**: Alternative investments (PE, VC, crypto, etc.)
- **Focus**: Platforms that provide fundamental analysis, not just trading or portfolio management
