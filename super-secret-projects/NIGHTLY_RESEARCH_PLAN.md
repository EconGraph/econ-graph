# Nightly Research Plan: Financial Data Extraction & STT Analysis

## Executive Summary

Tonight's research focuses on three massive opportunities:
1. **Audio vs Transcript vs Whisper Analysis** - Validate STT accuracy and identify value gaps
2. **XBRL Financial Statement Extraction** - Research bulk processing for thousands of companies
3. **Market Intelligence** - Map earnings call accessibility across industries

## Priority 1: XBRL Financial Statement Extraction Research

### Goal
Research bulk XBRL processing to extract financial statements from thousands of companies.

### Research Tasks
1. **SEC EDGAR Database Analysis**
   - Map XBRL filing patterns across companies
   - Identify filing frequencies and formats
   - Research bulk download capabilities

2. **XBRL Parser Evaluation**
   - Test `crabrl` on multiple company filings
   - Research non-AGPL alternatives (Arelle, xBRL-Forge)
   - Compare parsing accuracy and performance

3. **Financial Statement Extraction**
   - Test extraction of key financial metrics
   - Validate data accuracy against official reports
   - Document parsing challenges and edge cases

4. **Scale Analysis**
   - Estimate processing time for 1000+ companies
   - Identify infrastructure requirements
   - Map data storage and processing needs

### Expected Outcomes
- Validated XBRL parsing approach
- Performance benchmarks for bulk processing
- Technical architecture for scale

## Priority 2: Audio vs Transcript vs Whisper Analysis (Lower Priority)

### Goal
Compare official transcripts vs Whisper transcriptions to identify accuracy patterns and value opportunities.

### Research Tasks
1. **Download Google Q2 2025 official transcript** (if available)
2. **Compare Whisper output vs official transcript** line by line
3. **Identify accuracy patterns**:
   - Financial numbers accuracy
   - Technical terminology handling
   - Speaker identification quality
   - Punctuation and formatting differences
4. **Document value gaps** where official transcripts are better
5. **Create accuracy scoring framework**

### Expected Outcomes
- Quantified STT accuracy metrics
- Identification of edge cases where official transcripts are superior
- Framework for quality validation

## Priority 3: Market Intelligence & Accessibility Mapping

### Goal
Document earnings call availability patterns to identify market opportunities.

### Research Tasks
1. **Industry Analysis**
   - Map earnings call accessibility by industry
   - Identify registration requirements patterns
   - Document audio quality variations

2. **Company Tier Analysis**
   - Large cap vs mid cap accessibility
   - International vs US company patterns
   - Private vs public company differences

3. **Access Method Documentation**
   - Free access vs registration required
   - YouTube vs company IR sites
   - Third-party platforms (Quartr, Seeking Alpha)

### Expected Outcomes
- Market opportunity map
- Prioritized target company list
- Access strategy recommendations

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: XBRL Research (3-4 hours)
1. Test multiple XBRL parsers (crabrl, Arelle, xBRL-Forge)
2. Download and test on multiple company filings
3. Benchmark extraction accuracy and performance
4. Research bulk processing approaches
5. Document technical requirements and architecture

### Phase 2: STT Analysis (1-2 hours) - Lower Priority
1. Download Google official transcript (if available)
2. Create comparison framework
3. Run basic accuracy analysis
4. Document findings

### Phase 3: Market Mapping (1 hour)
1. Research company earnings call accessibility
2. Create market intelligence database
3. Identify high-value targets
4. Document access strategies

## Success Metrics

### STT Analysis Success
- [ ] Accuracy comparison framework created
- [ ] Quantified STT performance metrics
- [ ] Quality validation approach documented

### XBRL Research Success
- [ ] Validated parsing approach identified
- [ ] Performance benchmarks established
- [ ] Scale architecture designed

### Market Intelligence Success
- [ ] Company accessibility database created
- [ ] Market opportunity map completed
- [ ] Target prioritization framework established

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **XBRL Complexity**: Start with simple financial statements, expand gradually
- **STT Accuracy**: Focus on high-quality audio sources initially
- **Scale Challenges**: Design for incremental scaling

### Business Risks
- **Legal Considerations**: Document usage rights and restrictions
- **Competitive Response**: Focus on unique value propositions
- **Data Quality**: Implement validation frameworks

## Next Steps After Tonight

1. **Validate findings** with additional test cases
2. **Prototype key components** (STT pipeline, XBRL parser)
3. **Create business case** based on research findings
4. **Design MVP architecture** for production system
