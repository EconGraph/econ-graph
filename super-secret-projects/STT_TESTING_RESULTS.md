# Speech-to-Text Testing Results: Earnings Call Analysis

## Executive Summary

Initial testing of OpenAI Whisper on Google/Alphabet earnings calls demonstrates **exceptional accuracy** for financial terminology and earnings call content. This validates the core hypothesis that STT technology can effectively transcribe earnings calls for financial analysis.

## Key Findings

### Google Q2 2025 Earnings Call Results
- **Audio Source**: YouTube-hosted earnings call
- **STT Model**: OpenAI Whisper (base model)
- **Accuracy**: Near-perfect transcription of financial terminology
- **Content Quality**: Clear speaker identification, proper punctuation, accurate financial numbers

### Technical Performance
- **Financial Terms**: Correctly transcribed complex financial jargon
- **Numbers**: Accurate transcription of financial figures and percentages  
- **Speaker Changes**: Proper identification of different speakers
- **Timing**: Real-time transcription capability
- **Audio Quality**: Works well with professional earnings call audio

## Industry Validation Hypothesis

**Question**: Was Google's success due to tech industry bias in Whisper's training data?

**Testing Approach**: 
- Google (tech) = ‚úÖ Excellent results
- Need to test: Oil/mining companies with different terminology
- Target companies: Exxon, Chevron, BP, Shell (large IR budgets)

**Expected Differences**:
- Oil terminology: "barrels per day," "upstream/downstream," "reserves"
- Mining terminology: "extraction costs," "commodity prices," "ore grades"
- Different accents/regional variations
- Potentially different audio quality

## Strategic Implications

### If STT Works Across Industries
- **Massive Market Opportunity**: All public company earnings calls become accessible
- **Competitive Advantage**: Real-time transcription of any earnings call
- **Scalability**: Automated processing of thousands of earnings calls

### If STT Has Industry Bias
- **Tech Focus**: Concentrate on tech companies initially
- **Gradual Expansion**: Fine-tune models for specific industries
- **Hybrid Approach**: Combine STT with industry-specific training

## Next Steps

1. **Validate Cross-Industry Performance**
   - Test oil/mining company earnings calls
   - Compare accuracy across different industries
   - Document any industry-specific challenges

2. **Scale Testing**
   - Test multiple companies per industry
   - Compare audio quality impact on accuracy
   - Measure performance across different time periods

3. **Production Readiness**
   - Optimize for speed vs. accuracy tradeoffs
   - Implement quality validation systems
   - Build automated processing pipeline

## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks
- **Industry Bias**: Whisper may be overtrained on tech content
- **Audio Quality**: Poor recordings could significantly impact accuracy
- **Regional Accents**: Non-US accents might reduce accuracy

### Business Risks
- **Access Limitations**: Some companies may restrict audio access
- **Legal Considerations**: Usage rights for transcribed content
- **Competitive Response**: Large financial data providers may respond

## Conclusion

The Google earnings call results are **exceptionally promising** and suggest that STT technology may be ready for production use in financial analysis. However, cross-industry validation is critical before scaling.

**Key Insight**: The quality of results from Google suggests this technology could be a game-changer for financial research, but we need to validate it works beyond the tech industry before making major commitments.
