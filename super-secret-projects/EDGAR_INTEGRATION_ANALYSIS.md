## SEC EDGAR Database Overview

### What is EDGAR?

**EDGAR** (Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval) is the SEC's system for collecting, validating, indexing, accepting, and forwarding submissions by companies and others required by law to file forms with the SEC.

**Key Characteristics:**
- **Mandatory Filing**: All public companies must file quarterly (10-Q) and annual (10-K) reports
- **Real-time Updates**: New filings appear within 4 hours of submission
- **Historical Data**: Complete archive back to 1994
- **Free Access**: No authentication required for basic access
- **Machine Readable**: XBRL format since 2009 (mandatory for large companies)

### Filing Types and Frequency

**Quarterly Reports (10-Q):**
- Filed within 40-45 days after quarter end
- Contains quarterly financial statements
- ~13,000 filings per year

**Annual Reports (10-K):**
- Filed within 60-75 days after fiscal year end
- Comprehensive annual financial statements
- ~4,000 filings per year

**Other Important Filings:**
- 8-K (Material Events): Filed within 4 business days
- Proxy Statements (DEF 14A): Annual shareholder information
- Registration Statements (S-1, S-3): IPO and secondary offerings

### XBRL (eXtensible Business Reporting Language)

**What is XBRL?**
XBRL is a freely available, open standard for exchanging business information. It provides a standardized way to prepare, publish, and exchange financial statements and other business reports.

**Key Benefits:**
- **Machine Readable**: Structured data vs. PDF text
- **Standardized**: Common taxonomy for financial concepts
- **Extensible**: Companies can define custom concepts
- **Validation**: Built-in data integrity checks
- **Searchable**: Easy to find specific financial metrics

**XBRL Structure:**
```
Company Filing
├── Instance Document (actual data values)
├── Taxonomy Extension (company-specific concepts)
├── Linkbase (relationships between concepts)
└── Schema (data definitions)
```

## Technical Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Metadata Crawling and Discovery

**Objective**: Build a comprehensive catalog of available XBRL filings without parsing the actual financial data.

**Technical Approach:**

1. **EDGAR API Integration**
   - SEC provides REST API: `https://data.sec.gov/api/xbrl/`
   - Rate limiting: 10 requests per second (very generous)
   - No authentication required for basic access

2. **Filing Discovery Process**
   ```rust
   // Pseudo-code for filing discovery
   async fn discover_company_filings(company_cik: &str) -> Vec<Filing> {
       // Get company facts (all filings)
       let response = client.get(&format!(
           "https://data.sec.gov/api/xbrl/companyfacts/CIK{:010}.json", 
           company_cik
       )).send().await?;
       
       // Parse and extract filing metadata
       // - Filing date, form type, accession number
       // - XBRL instance document URLs
       // - Taxonomy information
   }
   ```

3. **Database Schema Design**
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE companies (
       cik VARCHAR(20) PRIMARY KEY,
       name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
       ticker VARCHAR(10),
       sic_code VARCHAR(10),
       industry VARCHAR(100),
       last_updated TIMESTAMP
   );
   
   CREATE TABLE filings (
       id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
       company_cik VARCHAR(20) REFERENCES companies(cik),
       accession_number VARCHAR(20) UNIQUE,
       form_type VARCHAR(10),
       filing_date DATE,
       period_end_date DATE,
       xbrl_url TEXT,
       instance_document_url TEXT,
       taxonomy_urls TEXT[],
       file_size_bytes BIGINT,
       discovered_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
   );
   
   CREATE TABLE xbrl_concepts (
       id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
       filing_id UUID REFERENCES filings(id),
       concept_name VARCHAR(255),
       concept_value DECIMAL(20,4),
       unit_type VARCHAR(50),
       period_start DATE,
       period_end DATE,
       dimension_context JSONB,
       extracted_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
   );
   ```

### Phase 2: XBRL Parsing and Data Extraction

**Objective**: Extract structured financial data from XBRL filings.

**Technical Implementation:**

1. **XBRL Parser Integration**
   ```rust
   use crabrl::XbrlParser;
   
   async fn parse_xbrl_filing(instance_url: &str) -> Result<Vec<Concept>, Error> {
       // Download XBRL instance document
       let content = download_xbrl_document(instance_url).await?;
       
       // Parse using crabrl
       let parser = XbrlParser::new();
       let document = parser.parse(&content)?;
       
       // Extract financial concepts
       let concepts = extract_financial_concepts(&document);
       
       Ok(concepts)
   }
   ```

2. **Financial Statement Mapping**
   - **Balance Sheet**: Assets, Liabilities, Equity
   - **Income Statement**: Revenue, Expenses, Net Income
   - **Cash Flow Statement**: Operating, Investing, Financing activities
   - **Key Ratios**: P/E, Debt-to-Equity, ROE, etc.

3. **Data Quality and Validation**
   - Cross-reference with GAAP standards
   - Validate mathematical relationships (Assets = Liabilities + Equity)
   - Flag unusual values or trends
   - Handle restatements and corrections

### Phase 3: API and User Interface

**Objective**: Provide clean, accessible API for financial data consumption.

**API Design:**
```rust
// Example API endpoints
GET /api/companies/{cik}/filings
GET /api/companies/{cik}/financial-statements/{period}
GET /api/companies/{cik}/metrics/{metric_name}
GET /api/screener?industry=technology&metric=revenue_growth
```

## SEC EDGAR Crawling Strategy

### Rate Limiting and Politeness

**SEC Guidelines:**
- **Rate Limit**: 10 requests per second (very generous)
- **User Agent**: Must identify your application
- **Respectful Usage**: Don't overwhelm the system
- **Caching**: Cache responses to minimize requests

**Implementation:**
```rust
pub struct EdgarCrawler {
    client: Client,
    rate_limiter: RateLimiter,
    cache: Cache,
}

impl EdgarCrawler {
    async fn crawl_company_facts(&self, cik: &str) -> Result<CompanyFacts, Error> {
        // Respect rate limits
        self.rate_limiter.acquire().await;
        
        // Check cache first
        if let Some(cached) = self.cache.get(&format!("facts:{}", cik)).await {
            return Ok(cached);
        }
        
        // Make request with proper user agent
        let response = self.client
            .get(&format!("https://data.sec.gov/api/xbrl/companyfacts/CIK{:010}.json", cik))
            .header("User-Agent", "EconGraph/1.0 (contact@example.com)")
            .send()
            .await?;
        
        let facts: CompanyFacts = response.json().await?;
        
        // Cache the response
        self.cache.set(&format!("facts:{}", cik), &facts, Duration::hours(24)).await;
        
        Ok(facts)
    }
}
```

### Data Discovery Process

1. **Company Identification**
   - Start with S&P 500, Russell 2000, etc.
   - Use SEC company tickers API
   - Build comprehensive company database

2. **Filing Discovery**
   - Query company facts endpoint for each company
   - Extract all available filings with XBRL data
   - Store metadata in database

3. **Incremental Updates**
   - Daily crawls for new filings
   - Track last filing dates per company
   - Handle amendments and restatements

## Conclusion

The SEC EDGAR integration represents a significant opportunity to democratize access to fundamental financial data. By leveraging the freely available XBRL data from the SEC, we can provide institutional-quality financial information at a fraction of the cost of existing providers.

The technical implementation is challenging but feasible, with the main complexity lying in XBRL parsing and data quality validation. However, the potential market impact and business value make this a compelling project that could establish us as a leader in the financial data space.

The phased approach allows us to validate the concept with basic metadata crawling before investing in the more complex XBRL parsing infrastructure. This reduces risk while providing early value to users.

**Next Steps:**
1. Validate SEC EDGAR API access and data quality
2. Build basic company and filing discovery system
3. Prototype XBRL parsing with crabrl
4. Design database schema and API architecture
5. Create MVP for beta testing
